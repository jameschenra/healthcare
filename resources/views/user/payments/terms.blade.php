            <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
            <br />
            <p>Below are our Terms of Service, which outline a lot of legal goodies, but the bottom line is it’s our aim to always take care of both you, as a customer, or as a seller on our platform. We’ve included many of these terms to legally protect ourselves, but if you have an issue, always feel free to email us at themes@getbootstrap.com and we’ll do our best to resolve it in a fair and timely fashion.</p>
            <br />
